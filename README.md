# Subtitle Generator

This project is a **Subtitle Generator** implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The application processes a video or audio file and generates subtitles automatically. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to transcribe speech into text and format it into subtitles.

# Features

- **Automatic Subtitle Generation**: Generates subtitles directly from video or audio files.
- **NLP-based Transcription**: Uses speech-to-text technology for accurate transcription of spoken words.
- **Subtitle Formatting**: Automatically formats the transcribed text into subtitle-compatible formats (e.g., `.srt`).
- **Language Support**: Can support multiple languages depending on the speech recognition model used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project is implemented in a notebook, making it easy to modify and experiment with.
